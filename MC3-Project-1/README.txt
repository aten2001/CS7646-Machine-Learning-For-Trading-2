You are to implement and evaluate three learning algorithms as Python classes: A KNN learner, a Linear Regression learner (provided) and a Bootstrap Aggregating learner. The classes should be named KNNLearner, LinRegLearner, and BagLearner respectively. We are considering this a regression problem (not classification). So the goal is to return a continuous numerical result (not a discrete result).

In this project we are training & testing with static spatial data. In the next project we will make the transition to time series data.

You must write your own code for KNN and bagging. You are NOT allowed to use other peoples' code to implement KNN or bagging.

The project has two main components: The code for your learners, which will be auto graded, and your report, report.pdf that should include the components listed below.

Your learner should be able to handle any dimension in X from 1 to N.
