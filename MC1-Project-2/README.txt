Implement a Python function named find_optimal_allocations() that can find the optimal allocations for a given stock portfolio. You should optimize for Sharpe ratio.

The function should accept as input historical stock prices (supplied as a pandas dataframe, with each column representing one equity), and return a list of floats (as a one-dimensional numpy array) that represents the allocations to each of the equities. Use functions developed in the portfolio analysis project to compute daily portfolio value and statistics.
