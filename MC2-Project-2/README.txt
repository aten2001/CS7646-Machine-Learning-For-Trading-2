In this project you will develop trading strategies using Technical Analysis, then test them using your market simulator.

In this project we shift from an auto graded code format to a report format. For this project your grade will be based on the PDF report you submit, not your code. However, you will also submit your code that will be checked visually to ensure it appropriately matches the report you submit.
